# Unsupervised-Learning

Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning technique that learns patterns from untagged data and in which the users do not need to supervise the model. The repository contains academic projects using unsupervise learning algorithms such as Clustering (KNN), Dimension Reduction (PCA) and Association Rule Mining (Apriori).
